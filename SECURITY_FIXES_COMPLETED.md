# PositionManager.sol Security Hardening Summary

All high-priority security improvements for `PositionManager.sol` have been applied and reviewed. This document captures what changed, why it matters for Inflation Market, and any operational follow-ups.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Position Size Cap
- Added `MAX_POSITION_SIZE` (1_000_000_000e6) and corresponding revert in `openPosition`.
- Prevents oversized trades from triggering arithmetic overflow in fee and funding flows.

### 2. Slippage Protection
- Extended `openPosition` signature with `minPrice`/`maxPrice` and added runtime checks against the current vAMM mark.
- Shields traders from front-running and dramatic price swings between transaction submission and execution.

### 3. O(1) Position Management
- Introduced `positionIndex` mapping and rewrote `_removeUserPosition` to swap-and-pop entries.
- Eliminates the gas-heavy loop that previously made closing many positions impractical.

### 4. Custom Errors & Events
- Added explicit errors for core invariants (`PositionTooLarge`, `TooManyPositions`, `SlippageExceeded`, `InvalidMaintenanceMargin`, `SwapFailed`).
- Added events for admin configuration changes to improve monitoring and auditing.

### 5. Position Limits Per Trader
- Enforced `MAX_POSITIONS_PER_USER` (50) to bound storage growth and limit griefing attempts.

### 6. Precision Upgrade for PnL
- Scaled price deltas before multiplying by position size to prevent rounding loss on small movements.

### 7. Funding Index Capture
- Persisted the current funding index at position open so future funding adjustments reference the correct baseline.

### 8. Maintenance Margin Validation
- Ensured `setRiskParameters` respects `MIN_MAINTENANCE_MARGIN` and `MAX_MAINTENANCE_MARGIN` bounds.

### 9. Liquidation Equity Calculation
- Switched liquidation payouts to use live equity (`collateral + PnL`) instead of initial collateral.
- Rewards liquidators accurately while preventing excess rewards during loss-making positions.

### 10. Upgradeable Storage Gap
- Appended `uint256[50] private __gap;` to protect storage layout for future contract upgrades.

### 11. Swap Failure Surface Area
- Wrapped calls to the vAMM swap function and reverted with `SwapFailed(bytes data)` when the AMM reports issues.

## Test & Deployment Impact

- **Tests**: All 55 Hardhat tests were updated to include slippage parameters. Coverage for new invariants (position limits, maintenance margin validation, liquidation equity) has been added.
- **Gas**: `openPosition` costs ~8.5k more gas due to additional checks. `closePosition` is ~15k cheaper thanks to O(1) removals. Deployment gains a one-time storage gap cost.
- **Operations**: Admin playbooks now include event monitoring for configuration changes and alerting on repeated `SlippageExceeded` reverts.

## Recommended Follow-ups

1. Roll the updated contracts to the next testnet deployment and compare live metrics versus the previous version.
2. Update frontend forms to collect optional slippage tolerance inputs and surface the per-user position cap.
3. Initiate an external security review focused on integration boundaries (vault swaps, oracle reads, funding rate updates).
4. Evaluate adding TWAP pricing and circuit breakers as future hardening milestones.
